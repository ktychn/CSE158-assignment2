November 2024 -- UC San Diego, CSE 158 (Web Mining and Recommender Systems), Fall Quarter 2024  

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I used to perform analysis of a [MyAnimeList dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist?select=UserAnimeList.csv). I generated models to predict whether a user had watched a given anime (using user-to-user similarity heuristics and logistic regression), and what score a user would give to an anime (using a latent factor model implemented with [Surprise's SVD algorithm](https://surpriselib.com/). For a full description of the dataset, my process, and results, check out [my report](https://github.com/ktychn/CSE158-assignment2/blob/main/CSE%20158%20Assignment%202%20Report.pdf).
